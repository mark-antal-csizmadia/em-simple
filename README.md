# em-simple

Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating maximum likelihood (ML) parameters of partially observed data on a three-node Bayesian Network Probabilistic Graphical Model.

Concepts in focus: sufficient statistics of distributions, EM, data observability models such as Missing At Random (MAR), complete data log-likelihood.
